 I light the first led in asm, next time I should 
 set the environment for C, just like the bootloader.

 There are also couple problems occurred with UART
 shit me. I think it may be the PCLK.

 Haha, my guess it right, I add the clock.S to initialize
 the system clock and enable FIFO in UART so that s3c6410  
 can connect with PC normally now. And, I found that there
 are some difference between *.s and *.S. *.S file can  
 precompile while *.s can not! So I change the *.s into *S.
 next time try to enable the lcd at s3c6410.

 For make more simple, I change the clock.S into clock.c.
 And, new a Makefile into driver/ in order to expand easily
 in the future. OK, the lcd driver should be began in the  
 next time. :-)
