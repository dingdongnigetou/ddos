 I light the first led in asm, next time I should 
 set the environment for C, just like the bootloader.

 There are also couple problems occurred with UART
 shit me. I think it may be the PCLK. 

-Wed Mar 26, 2014
 Haha, my guess it right, I add the clock.S to initialize
 the system clock and enable FIFO in UART so that s3c6410  
 can connect with PC normally now. And, I found that there
 are some difference between *.s and *.S. *.S file can  
 precompile while *.s can not! So I change the *.s into *S.
 next time try to enable the lcd at s3c6410.

 For make more simple, I change the clock.S into clock.c.
 And, new a Makefile into driver/ in order to expand easily
 in the future. OK, the lcd driver should be began in the  
 next time. :-)

 I made a git mistake yesterday. I use "git reset --hard HEAD^" 
 to undo the last commit that wrong. So, my source back to the
 older one... so that I should rewrite parts of them... Now I
 see I should use "git reset --soft HEAD^" witch just undo the
 commit though the source.  
 I find that lcd driver is more difficult than uart driver. So 
 it maybe takes me more time. But, I just like the work that
 is not easily. :)

 The background light driver is so difficult that I have to   
 read other people's code for it. But, it's so funny! 

-Tue Apr 1, 2014
 Happy April Fool's Day. :)
 Today I finish the background light driver! And it works well.

 So difficult... Fight!!!

 I find that I should learn the hardware coding of ARM seriously~
 Let's watch the teaching video. :)

 Now, it read code(just 8K) from nand flash into memory, and then copy 
 itself into DDR.
 I initialize the DDR, so I have 512M memory that under my control.

-Wed Apr 9, 2014
 OK, the lcd is working well now! Next time write character into lcd.

-Thu Apr 10, 2014
 Shit, I found the error that can not write character on lcd finally.
 The size of bin is more than 8K... So, we should initialize the nand 
 flash so that we can read data form it and copy them into DDR. Because 
 the hardware always read the first 8K data in nand flash.

-Mon Apr 14, 2014
 The nand flash driver doesn't work! I can't find the fault today.
 Everything will be OK. :)

 Nand flash read function can't work!!! But the erase function works well.
