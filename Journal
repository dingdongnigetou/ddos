 I light the first led in asm, next time I should 
 set the environment for C, just like the bootloader.

 There are also couple problems occurred with UART
 shit me. I think it may be the PCLK.

 Haha, my guess it right, I add the clock.S to initialize
 the system clock and enable FIFO in UART so that s3c6410  
 can connect with PC normally now. And, I found that there
 are some difference between *.s and *.S. *.S file can  
 precompile while *.s can not! So I change the *.s into *S.
 next time try to enable the lcd at s3c6410.

 For make more simple, I change the clock.S into clock.c.
 And, new a Makefile into driver/ in order to expand easily
 in the future. OK, the lcd driver should be began in the  
 next time. :-)

 I made a git mistake yesterday. I use "git reset --hard HEAD^" 
 to undo the last commit that wrong. So, my source back to the
 older one... so that I should rewrite parts of them... Now I
 see I should use "git reset --soft HEAD^" witch just undo the
 commit though the source.  
 I find that lcd driver is more difficult than uart driver. So 
 it maybe takes me more time. But, I just like the work that
 is not easily. :)

 The background light driver is so difficult that I have to   
 read other people's code for it. But, it's so funny!
