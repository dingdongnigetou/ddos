Initialization
==============
  We should initialize the DRAM controller first. Folowing steps:
  * Program memc_cmd to '3'b100', which makes DRAM controller enter
    'conifg' state.
  * Write memory timing parameter, chip configuration, and id 
    configuration register.
  * Wait 200us to allow SDRAM power and clock to stabilize. However,
    when Cpu starts working, power and clock would already be stabilized.
  * Execute memory initialization sequence.
  * Check memory status field in memc_stat until memory status becomes
    '2'b01', which means 'Ready'.
  
  You can see the details in S3C610X.pdf.

Interface
=============
   * Only the sdram_init() for now. Called when boot.
