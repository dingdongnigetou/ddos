=========
  * void nand_erase_block(unsigned long addr);
    You can use this to erase number addr block.  
    We have 128 * 1024 blocks. So if we want erase the 
    all nandflash:
    for (i = 0; i < 128 * 1024; i++)
             nand_erase_block(i);

  * void nand_write(unsigned int nand_start, unsigned char * buf, 
                    unsigned int len);
    Write the data in buf into nandflash.

  * int copy2ddr(unsigned int nand_start, unsigned int ddr_start, 
		unsigned int len);
    Copy program form ddr into nand flash. It's called when boot.
    
  * We set nand_read() and other functions as static because they
    are not necessary for us.
